# Satellite Decay Simulator

A simple Python simulation of a satellite's orbital decay due to atmospheric drag in low Earth orbit (LEO).

## Overview

This project models how satellites gradually lose altitude over time, focusing on atmospheric drag as the dominant force. It was inspired by the Kosmos 482 mission and aims to demonstrate basic principles of orbital mechanics in a computationally accessible way.

## Features

- Computes orbital decay over time based on altitude, mass, cross-sectional area, drag coefficient, and atmospheric density.
- Simulates and plots decay curves.
- Supports multiple altitudes and step sizes for comparison.
- Designed to be readable and easy to modify.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy (optional for integration)
- Pandas (optional for CSV output)

## Example Output

(yet to add)

## Future Ideas

- Integrate real TLE data with SGP4
- Use a more accurate atmospheric model
- Animate orbit decay
- Add re-entry modeling or GUI interface
